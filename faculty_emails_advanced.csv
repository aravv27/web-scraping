The Department was established in 1960, the year in which the university itself was founded. The journey started with 4 teachers and 30 students, and M.A. in English was the only course offered by the department initially. In the seventies, undergraduate and subsidiary courses were introduced whereas M. Phil was introduced in the mid-eighties. Incidentally, English was the first department in the university to offer the course. Today, the department has 12 full-time teaching positions, 3 non-teaching positions, 1 part-time non-teaching staff and a combined strength of about 250 students in the postgraduate course. In addition to this, there are several full-time and part-time scholars engaged in research towards their Ph.D. degrees in English. The Department has consistently tried to ensure that teachers remain available to the students as much as possible for any kind of academic advice and would like to further develop its long-standing reputation of promoting teaching and research inside as well as outside the classroom. National as well as international conferences are organized by the Department as are workshops and one-day lectures by eminent academicians. The faculty members have also marked their distinction in presenting research papers, chairing academic sessions at national/international conferences across the globe and published research articles in books/journals of national as well as international repute.

The Department had a modest beginning under the stewardship of Prof. S.R. Dutta Gupta. Since then the Department has grown in size and offered quality education in Economics at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels. The undergraduate course in Economics was discontinued in the early part of the last decade when the colleges located in the districts of Nadia and Murshidabad were brought under the jurisdiction of this University. The Department of Economics remained the first department in the eastern region to introduce a special paper in Population Economics. In recent years, a number of innovative papers have been introduced in its Post-graduate curriculum; viz., Natural Resources and Environmental Economics, Input-Output Economics, Financial Economics, Comparative Economic Systems, World Development, Industrial Organizations, Derivatives and Risk Management, etc. Of late, a compulsory paper on Computer Applications in Economics including a Project Work has been introduced to meet the demand of the present time. In fact, periodic up-gradation of the post-graduate syllabus is done at the Department to meet the growing needs of the students as far as the recent developments in Economics are concerned. Apart from offering a MA/M.Sc degree in Economics to the students who qualify BA/B.Sc (Hons.) in Economics the Department also offers M.Phil and Ph.D. degrees as per the University rules and regulations in this regard. So far, since its inception, a good number of research scholars have obtained their doctoral degrees from the Department after the fruitful completion of their research work. The students who passed out from the Department are well placed in various academic institutions including many universities within and outside the state like Visva Bharati, Jadavpur University, etc., research institutes like Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (IGIDR), Mumbai, Gokhale Institute of Economics and Politics, Pune, Indian Statistical Institute, etc, and also in various undergraduate colleges and schools, in administrative services including West Bengal Civil Services and like, in banks and insurance companies, and in other services like print and electronic media. The Department was offered DRS-I (UGC-SAP) for a five-year period during 2007-12. The faculties of the Department regularly participate in international and national seminars, conferences, workshops, and symposia as paper presenters and also as resource persons. Some faculty members of the Department received invitations from foreign universities and research institutes to visit them as guest faculty/resource persons. At regular intervals every year for more than a decade the Department holds international as well as national and state-level conferences. For this, the Department has received grants from outside agencies like the Indian Council of Social Science Research, the Reserve Bank of India, and the University Grants Commission. These conferences have provided ample scopes for mutual interaction among the experts in the subject and also between the research scholars and students. Also, in the recent past, the Department has held research scholars’ workshops where scholars pursuing their doctoral research in various universities and institutes got the opportunity to present their works before the experts in the respective fields and received comments and suggestions to improve the quality of their works. Besides, the Department held some special workshops with the help of the Census of India and the like. The Departmental Library has around 4,000 books and journals. In 2011, the entire stock of these books and journals was computerized. The reading room in the Library can be used by the students, scholars and the teachers of the Department for the purpose of consultation of any reading material in the library. The Department of Labour of Government of West Bengal generously donates from time to time for subscription and/or purchase of periodicals, journals and books which are of immense use for any competitive examination meant for different government and non-government jobs for the students studying Economics at the Post-Graduate level. In 2007, an air-conditioned Computer Lab was set up on the first floor of the department with LAN connection and internet facility which can be used by any student, scholar, and teacher of the department during working hours on any working day. The setting up of this Computer Lab has facilitated (a) the introduction of a compulsory paper in Computer Application and (b) research works for the scholars and the students. A seminar room was also set up in the Department in the year 2007 where small seminars, workshops, and lectures are organized at regular intervals. The seminar room has air conditioning comfort and a modern-day PowerPoint presentation facility. At present, the faculties of the Department including the Head of the Department and the Office of the Department are equipped with a desktop computer along with a printer and also, with internet facility. The Department is now in the process of bringing out its own peer-reviewed journal Kalyani University Journal of Economics (KUJE) bearing ISSN. The first issue of the Journal is expected in March 2014. A plan to bring out a web version of the journal is also under consideration at the moment keeping in mind the present practice of publication all over the world. Some of the faculty members of the Department remained involved from time to time in research projects sponsored by the outside funding agencies like ICSSR, SANDEE, and like. Programmes offered Sl.

Professor Tarun Chandra Bose, a UGC National Lecturer and a name in the US Hall of Fame, joined the department during the Sixth Plan and served till his retirement. It was during the Seventh Plan that another teaching post and a post of Research Associate were gained by the department. Though the department started as a minor, over the years it gained some reputation as a good teaching place. The department through its sheer quality of teaching has placed some of its students in high positions of the corporate world, university positions and teaching positions in the colleges of West Bengal and other states. The number of seats for students has increased steadily to touch the 100th mark in 2002. At present thirty-six of the thirty-nine colleges and institutions affiliated to our University send their students to the department, which is gearing up to transmute this expanded influx of human resource. A forward looking entity, the department has always taught updated syllabi. The teachers are not only engaged in dissemination of learing, but have enriched the discipline of Political Science through their researches, thus participating in its creation too. Poised to offer a Diploma Course in Human Rights and Duties Education, the department is planning to adjust to the post-liberalisation age of higher learning, education and its challenges. Scarcity of human and material resource sometimes interferes with its progress. But the department believes that its motto should be “to seek, to strive, to find and not to yield”.

As early as in 1964, the department started its journey with a subsidiary course in Sociology at under-graduate level. A couple of years later, a post- graduate course in Sociology had been introduced (1966) and the under-graduate (Honors) course only followed soon (1972). The department, since its inception, claims appreciation from all quarters for its close and continuous academic interaction with the peer departments in India and abroad with the aim of achieving academic excellence. As well, the department has always remained sufficiently responsive to the needs of her rural/semi-urban roots. In consistent with her perceived goals i.e.; achieving academic excellence and sustainable development of the community around, the department has already undertaken a good number of programs apart from updating the syllabi (both core and optional) at regular intervals through incorporation of contemporary ideas and issues. The department further plans to pursue a series of newer programs in the near future. These include sponsored/collaborative research with peer departments in India and abroad as well as out-reach/extension programs. In fact, the department has sincerely been striving to make optimum utilization of the available resources to achieve her “twin goals” referred to here-in above.

Sen, F.N.A. It started with a limited number of students as a small centre for Graduate (Honours) & Post Graduate studies and research in Botany. But soon it developed into a centre of academic excellence and earned a prominent place in the academic map in India, which was evident from the facts that the UGC selected the Department for funding in the (i) Departmental Research Support (DRS) Programme with Plant Molecular Biology as the thrust area for the tenure 1978-1984, (ii) the Special Assistance Programme-I (SAP-I), with a thrust area on Developmental Botany, Molecular Taxonomy, Molecular Genetics and Molecular Plant Pathology for the tenure 1985-1990 and (iii) the Special Assistance Programme-II (SAP-II), with Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology as the thrust area for the tenure 1991-1996. The department also earned the privilege of being selected for the UGC-COSIST Programme (1996-2000) for developing its infrastructure and research. In addition, the DBT, Govt. of India selected the Department as a centre for improving standards of teaching and imparting training in Microbiology for a period between 1995-1998. The Department is still maintaining its reputation as a centre with high standard in teaching and research Programmes offered Sl.

Definition of Physiology: Physiology; from Greek words (physis), meaning “nature, origin”, and (-logia), meaning “study of”, is the scientific study of function in living systems. This includes how within organisms, organ systems, tissues, cells and bio-molecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Physiological investigations range from examining the molecular basis of life to understanding the integrative functions of biological systems and their responses to external and internal environments. Physiology enables information gained by molecular biology, cell biology, genetics, pharmacology, biophysics, biomathematics, and biochemistry to be described in an integrated manner that can be applied to human medicine. The study of human physiology dates back to at least 420 BC and the time of Hippocrates, also known as the father of medicine. The highest honour awarded in physiology is the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine, awarded since 1901 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Programmes offered Sl.

The Department was established as a Govt. sponsored Teachers’ Training College in 1958. The Department expanded its programme of studies and research in 1970-71 and introduced two-year MA/M.Sc course in Education. Thereupon, during the 5th. Plan UGC became satisfied to sanction more teaching posts which stood as: Professor-one, Reader-four, and Lecturer –sixteen including one Co-ordinator for its Extension wing (NCERT). Since then research programme sprung up vigorously. It got further stimulation in the hefty days of re-organization of the national educational scenario with the NEP, 1986 and initiated M.Phil in Education, eventually the first in the Eastern part of the country. In maintaining continuous growth spurt, the B.Ed. Course got permanent recognition of NCTE in 1999. The strength and potential of Department was duly assessed by the MHRD, and the Higher Education Department, Government of West Bengal and upgraded it as Institute of Advanced Studies in Education (IASE) in 2000. Subsequently, it received central Capital Grants of Rs.115 lakh for expansion of infrastructure in specified dimensions. With this funds the Department has been more enriched in –teaching –learning supports facilities of all kinds including departmental library and laboratories besides extension & building of physical infrastructure. New ICT Lab has also been built . Thereby old existing curricula have been modified and / or updated for preparing qualified man-power to fit themselves in contemporary world of education.

While the Report of the Education Commission (1964-66) observed that education does not end with schooling but is a lifelong process; the National Policy on Education in India – 1986 (modified in 1992) considered Lifelong Education as the cherished goal of the educational process which presupposes universal literacy, provision of opportunities for youth, housewives, agricultural and industrial workers and professionals to continue the education of their choice at the pace suited to them. National Education Policy 2020 emphasized that the global education development agenda reflected in the Goal 4 (SDG4) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by India in 2015 – seeks to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030. Also, the 12 th Five-Year Plan (2012–2017) estimated that only a very small percentage of the Indian workforce in the age group of 19–24 (less than 5%) received formal vocational education Whereas in countries such as the USA the number is 52%, in Germany 75%, and South Korea it is as high as 96%. These numbers only underline the urgency of the need to hasten the spread of vocational education in India. Considering all, the Department of Lifelong Learning & Extension (erstwhile Adult, Continuing Education & Extension) was set up in 1986 as sanctioned by University Grants Commission during 6 th five-year plan. Presently, the department has conducted in three different areas as mentioned by UGC that is, Research, Teaching, and Extension Programmes. Research As a part of research, the department has undertaken research projects on different aspects of Lifelong Learning and Education. Till date seven scholars have been awarded the Ph.D. degree and four are working. They have already published 80 research articles in different national and international journals with high impact factor.

The walls which divide the gown and the town have crumbled and the life of the university and that of the community can be vitally linked for their mutual enrichment. We also feel that some university in the country should develop full departments of adult education.
